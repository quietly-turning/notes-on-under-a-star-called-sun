# notes-on-under-a-star-called-sun
in which I learn Twine basics by recreating cecile richard's game

## motivation

I played cecile richard's browser game [under a star called sun](https://haraiva.itch.io/under-a-star-called-sun) and loved it.
it moved me and stirred my creative drive — I, too, wished to create something
that moved someone.

I'd been looking at [Twine](https://twinery.org/) for interactive fiction, and
thought mapping out *under a star called sun*'s flow could be a quick,
structured way to learn the basics.  and it was! :)

this repository is that.

this repository is not cecile richard's game *under a star called sun*.  I am
not cecille richard.  you shouldn't play this.  

you definitely *should* play the original here:
